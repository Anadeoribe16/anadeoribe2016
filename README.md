R Cran and Selenium Project


As part of strengthening the institutional capacity of the Mexican regulatory agencies, the government has implemented and strengthened competition legislation beginning with the Reformation on Telecommunications, Broadcasting and economic competition. In this sense, we as students of economics, we want to help in ending monopolistic behavior, reduce market concentration, remove entry barriers to new businesses and improving the business environment and living standards in Mexico.

To achieve this, we are designing a free and open mechanism for collecting public information about the offer each company have to reach consumers, enabling anyone to collect information from different companies providing the same service, and thus to choose the more convenient with better information.

Reader, feel free to contribute to this project the way you want, so together we can improve the way we do business in Mexico.
